# Contributing

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device
2. Install the dependencies: `yarn`
3. Build the code, start the app, and watch for changes: `yarn start`

To make sure that your code works in the finished app, you can generate the binary:

```
$ yarn pack
```

After that, you'll see the binary in the `dist` folder 😀
